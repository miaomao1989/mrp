A pcap repo containing randomly generated and malformed packets suitable for testing and fuzzing.

The pcaps were generated by the `randpkt tool <https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/randpkt.html>`_.    
All pcaps contain malformed packets and each pcap file name points to what the malformed packets are  - ip/udp/arp....

The pcap file - `arp-dns-eth-icmp-ip-udp-goodhttp-gooddns.pcapng ` contains malformed  - arp/dns/eth/icmp/ip/udp and real/valid dns and http sessions.
